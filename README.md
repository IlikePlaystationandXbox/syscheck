# Syscheck

Hello. I will walk through how to set Syscheck up on your PC!

First, right-click "syscheck.bat" and (if on Windows 11, click "show more options") click edit.
Open it with any text editor with a "Replace" tool for easier setup. Replace all "you" with your Users\ directory folder name.

And you're done! Now you can copy and paste the Syscheck tool's shortcut ANYWHERE!
(Haha funny batch file)
